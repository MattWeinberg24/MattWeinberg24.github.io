### To-Do
*Colors, fonts, and stuff like that will change all the time*
**Navigation Menu**: Finished May 19, 2021 ([Reference](https://youtu.be/gXkqy0b4M5g))

*Notable Deviations from Reference:*
* Simplified opacity fade-in by using transitions instead of animations, similar to how the other transitions were implemented
* Navigation menu is horizontal instead of vertical in mobile mode (mobile mode = small width screen)
* Menu button animation is different in mobile mode (rotates instead of becomes an X)
* Used space-evenly rather than space-around for flex elements

**Social Media Links**: Finished May 20, 2021

* Utilized what I learned about flexbox and aligning items
* Made both the image and the header a part of one link
